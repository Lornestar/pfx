The way we use this information 
</p>

<p>
Because UBNZ Markets is in the financial services business, it is important for us to know that the personal details provided by an individual are accurate. We use the information you provide about yourself to validate who you are, and to communicate with you from time to time. We do not share this information with outside parties except for government agencies where we are required to do so under law.

<p>
We use an individuals email address to answer the email we receive from them, in addition to sending automatic market notifications. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 
</p>
<p>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may publish details that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that X number of people from a certain country registered, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 
</p>
<p>
Our commitment to data security 
</p>
<p>
We understand that security is critical. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect and maintain.
